<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solvent Recycling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Site Solvent Recycling</li><li>Off-Site Solvent Recycling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solvent recycling market is divided into on-site and off-site recycling types. On-site solvent recycling involves processing waste solvents directly at the facility where they are generated, allowing for immediate reuse, reduced transportation costs, and lower environmental impact. In contrast, off-site solvent recycling entails shipping waste solvents to specialized facilities for processing. This method may offer advanced recycling technology and greater capacity but can involve higher transportation costs and longer turnaround times. Both types aim to improve sustainability and reduce hazardous waste.</p></p>
