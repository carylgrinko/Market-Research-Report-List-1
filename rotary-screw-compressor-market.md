<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary-screw Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-free</li><li>Oil-injected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary screw compressor market is divided into two main types: oil-free and oil-injected compressors. Oil-free compressors utilize a design that eliminates oil from the compression process, making them suitable for applications requiring pure air, such as food and pharmaceuticals. In contrast, oil-injected compressors use oil to lubricate the internal components, enhancing efficiency and cooling during operation. This type is often favored in heavy industrial applications where slightly contaminated air is acceptable, balancing performance and maintenance costs.</p></p>
